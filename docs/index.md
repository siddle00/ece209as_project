# Abstract

The goal of the project is to develop a Countermeasure (CM) system to complement the ASV system to verify the authenticity (original/fake) of a given audio sample. The model proposed in this work is a two step architecture that comprises of a feature extractor such as MFCC, CQCC, Mel spectrum followed by a ML classifier. We further evaluate and compare different ML classfiers along with different feature extraction model to understand the various architecture performances. We also explore the one class classification problem approach for this problem to handle the problem of generalization with unknown spoof attacks. Finally we list the moderl performances using two evaluation metrics namley EER and t-DCF.
